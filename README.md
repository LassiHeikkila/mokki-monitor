# mokki-monitoring
MÃ¶kki is a finnish term for a cabin. It is often left uninhabited for long periods of time in winter.

This application combines wireless environmental sensors with low power usage,
low cost internet connectivity via a NB-IoT / GPRS module and a low cost computer to provide DIY
environment monitoring at a remote cabin, visible through an InfluxDB dashboard.

## Sensors
Supported sensors are now just Ruuvitags, which are little discs sending out BLE advertisements containing raw data.
This is handled with github.com/LassiHeikkila/go-ruuvi library.
BLE packets are picked up by the Raspberry Pi bluetooth device and parsed with the library.

## Internet connectivity
Internet connectivity is handled by a Waveshare SIM7000E hat for a Raspberry Pi 4 (or other),
wrapped by github.com/LassiHeikkila/SIM7000
The library currently supports HTTP GET and POST, which should be enough for this application.

## InfluxDB
Parsed data is POSTed to influxdb. Parameters like URL, org name and bucket are given with config file (see Config section)
and auth token is given as enviromental variable.

## Config
Config is JSON formatted file, default path is `/etc/mokki.json`, but path can be changed with `-conf` flag
Example contents:
```JSON
{
	"influxDB": {
		"url": "http://example.com:8099/",
		"org": "org@example.com",
		"bucket": "data-bucket",
		"token": "my secret API token"
	},
	"updateIntervalS": 30,
	"comms": {
		"useDefaultClient": false,
		"useSIM7000": true,
		"sim7000": {
			"apn": "internet",
			"serialDevice": "/dev/ttyS0",
			"traceLoggingFile": "/var/log/sim7000trace.log"
		}
	}
}
```
